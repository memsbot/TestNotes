Setup Fix for Dell 4K Display

This has worked for the Dell P2415Qb 4k Display with the Dell Lattitude 7389  Model P29S  S/N D7NJNH2

1)Disconnect and reconnect power to display while conneted to displayport.  Changes complete 9:13 AM on 27Nov2019

2) Go to "Display settings"
     - be sure the 4k display is in the "Rearrange your displays" diagram.
     - select the display you wish to modify, in this case, select the Dell display. (it may not be active but may be on the the "Rearrange your displays" diagram.)
     -Under "Multiple displays"
          -Select "extend these displays"
          -It should now be displaying the extended desktop.  Changes complete 9:24 AM 27Nov2019
3) If that does not work, under "Multiple displays", change the       selection box to "Duplicate desktop on 2 and 3 then accept
      "Keep changes".  Then change back to "Extend desktop on 2 and 3" and then accept "Keep changes".
4) You may need to set display1 and 2 to Laptop display (display1) then Dell display to (diplay 2) then set to duplicate displays.  Then plug in HDMI display as display 3 then extend displays 1 and 3.
5)  I set laptop Dell to 125% scale and Dell 4k display to 150% scale and Seiki to 100%.
Changes complete 9:59 AM 27Nov2019
6) Found root cause.  It appears that there is a bad USB-C to DisplayPort cable.  Found this issue by moving cable and now the display does not respond at all.  Buy a new cable.
